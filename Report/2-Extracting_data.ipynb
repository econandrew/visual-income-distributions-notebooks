    "\n",
    "- **Unit record**. A vector of raw income (consumption) observations from an actual survey. This is the most common case, particularly for recent years in which survey availability has expanded. Typically this will have a sample size of several thousand, but ranges from under 1000 to over 100,000. For these datasets, statistics like headcount poverty and Gini index are calculated directly from the observations.\n",
    "- **Grouped**. A list of points on a Lorenz curve, the exact number depending on the detail at which grouped data were available. This format is most common for older data (especially pre-1990), where original survey observations are not available. It is also used for certain countries (e.g. China) where only grouped data are made available to the PovCalNet team. For these datasets, two parametric Lorenz curve models are fitted to the points, and statistics are calculated from the better-fitting distribution."
