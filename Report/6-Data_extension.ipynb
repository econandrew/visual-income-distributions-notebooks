    "> This section is subject to change. We have used a set of simple rules for interpolation, extrapolation and harmonization in order to have a sufficiently large set of distributions available to test out visualizations in the prototype. **We have erred heavily on the side of generating longer time series, rather than accurate data. Once we refine the visualizations we should probably revert to a more conservative set of rules.** At a minimum, the app should very clearly distinguish between survey years and imputed years."
